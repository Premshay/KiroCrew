    A BOOLEAN rather than the point's choice string, so the caller holds no copy of

    session unsampled, a timeout, an answer outside the two options, a failed
    import -- is ``False``, which is the steer path a manual Steer and the
    composer's default have always taken.

    Called for a send the dashboard's own human made while a turn is running, and
    nowhere else (the busy branch's ``_person_send`` conjunct): an app token, an
    integration or a cron has nobody watching the reply, and every such send
    already falls through to the fail-closed queue; an agent-origin send takes the
    manual steer path as a non-person steer. Consent and sampling are the
    seam's own gates, re-checked inside ``decide``.

    Never raises except cancellation. The seam may cost an observation and must
    never cost a send.
